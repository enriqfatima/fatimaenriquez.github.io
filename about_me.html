<h2>Introduction</h2>
Hello, my name is Fatima Enriquez. I am a senior at the University of California San Diego majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation. When I am not working, I am studying. If I am not studying then I am spending quality time with friends and family. I enjoy long walks along the beach, cooking, and trying new food! I have a dog, a golden retriever, he is currently 9 years old. I also have a cat, honeslty do not know his age...his name is meatball. I am excited to embark on this new chapter of my life after graduation. I am seeking a role where I can demonstrate and grow my current skills.
