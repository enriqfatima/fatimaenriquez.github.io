<h2>Introduction</h2>
With a background in Cognitive Science and Machine Learning, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and client-focused experience. My career has spanned client service coordination, administration, STEM education, allowing me to develop a versatile skill set.

Currently, as a Contract Generalist at Palomar Display Products, I contribute to cross-functional initiatives and support various aspects of operations, from project management to client relations. Prior to this, I served as a Service Coordinator at Data Net Solutions Group, where I managed client issues and ensured industry compliance. At Hyatt Vacation Club, I was honored with the 2023 Care Award for exceptional service and gained proficiency in CRM software and Tableau. My experience as a STEM Tutor at MiraCosta College further sharpened my problem-solving and critical thinking abilities, particularly in mathematics. Early in my career, I also developed strong client engagement and organizational skills as a Sales Associate at Michael Kors.

Proficient in Python, Java, and SQL, I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments where I can apply my technical knowledge and passion for service excellence to drive meaningful outcomes.
